    <h2>Sticky toffee pudding</h2>
    <p>
      Sticky toffee pudding is a classic British dessert that's easier to make
      than you think. Serve warm with cream, ice cream, or custard for a
      delicious, crowd-pleasing dessert. The sponge cake includes finely chopped
      dates which make it super moist but it doesn't taste of dates at all!
    </p>

    <h2>How to Make Sticky Toffee Pudding</h2>
    <p>Here's a step-by-step recipe for you to follow:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine dates and tea in a bowl; set aside to soak for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch
        round cake pan and line with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cream 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons sugar and butter until light and
        fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
        Sift in flour and baking powder and fold into the mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add baking soda, vanilla, and espresso granules to the date-tea mixture.
        Add mixture to the batter and stir to produce a loose, soft, dropping
        consistency. Pour into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted in the center comes
        out clean, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        When pudding is almost finished baking, combine 1/2 cup plus 1
        tablespoon sugar, 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 3/4 cup plus 1
        tablespoon golden syrup, and butter for the sauce in a heavy saucepan
        over low heat until melted. Simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from heat.
        Gradually stir in cream and vanilla. Return to the heat and stir until
        smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pudding from the oven. Spoon a little sauce onto each serving
        plate. Place a portion of pudding on top, then pour over more sauce.
        Serve remaining sauce on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>

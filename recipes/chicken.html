    </p>
    <h2>Crispy Fried Chicken Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      Here's what you'll need to make the best, crispiest fried chicken of your
      life:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Chicken: Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four
        pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery
        store.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buttermilk: Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it
        too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flour: All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something
        to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Seasonings: All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings
        something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil: Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high
        smoke point.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Crispy Fried Chicken</h2>
    <p>Here's a step-by-step recipe for you to follow:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
      <li>
        Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are
        cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with
        paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the
        bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a
        clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A
        PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with
        vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken
        in HOT oil on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes
        (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise
        heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken
        you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken
        in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.
      </li>
    </ol>
